This sample demonstrates some less common uses of the boundary system and recentering:
* Guardian bounds drawn. Both the rectangular play area, and the complete bounds.
* Use of tracking space node to prevent yaw change with reorient (optional).
* Set boundary color.
* Red boxes move at runtime to keep them inside the user's play area. Note difference between red boxes (kept inside guardian bounds) and gray boxes (maintain world position as normal).

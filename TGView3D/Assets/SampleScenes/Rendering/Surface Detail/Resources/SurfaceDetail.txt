This scene illustrates different ways creating surface detail by allowing you to toggle various techniques to get a sense of how well they work in VR. A typical approach is a normal map, but this may work less well in VR due to stereo depth cues conflicting with the shading cue. 

Note that parallax mapping and displacement shaders introduce significant aliasing and so are generally undesirable in VR.

Representing mathematical knowledge efficiently is a difficult task due to its inherent complexity. Modular representations like OMDoc/MMT~\cite{Kohlhase:OMDoc1.2,RabKoh:WSMSML13} orgainze it into  theories with 

Individual theories and their direct neighborhood as well as the global structure need to be highlighted in some way. A possible solution for this problem are theory graphs; however, there is no inherent layout and the sheer size of a graph complicates the use if no other processing is done before.

For this reason, we propose an interactive virtual reality theory-graph viewer. This system follows TGView~\cite{RupKohMue:fitgv17}, an already existing 2D-theory-graph viewer. This tool allows switching between several layouts such as a hierarchical or a force-directed one. Furthermore, nodes can be moved manually and different visual highlighting options are available.

Adding the depth as a third dimension to this concept helps to further organize the theory graph, as effectively more space is generated. Additionally, this offers an inherent way of filtering the information. Since it is possible to freely navigate through the 3D-graph, the user can easily focus on the current visible slice.

Porting the system to virtual reality is the logical consequence. The first advantage is the extremely wide field of view. In combination with the headtracking, this allows for a natural exploration of the represented knowledge. Secondly, special controllers simulate functions of the human hand, e.g. grabbing and pointing, which offer intuitive ways of interaction in the three-dimensional world. Last, the immersive experience of virtual reality stronger stimulates brain areas involved in spatial cognition compared to traditional computer graphics. This could possibly help finding certain patterns in the graph.

In order to optimize the 3D-viewer we will tailor current functionalities toward the
requirements of a virtual reality application, create specialized graph layout algorithms
and find smart ways of presenting the relevant pieces of information. By doing this, we
hope to not only create a system that can present theory graphs in a structured and
intuitive way, but also aid mathematicians in discovering new theories from the presented
knowledge.

# TGView3D
The TGView3D System is a 3D-theory graph viewer developed at the [KWARC group](http://kwarc.info) at [FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](http://www.fau.de) in the Unity Engine.

It is intended to be used with VR Hardware, to offer an immersive experience of the represented data.
In order to visualize the complex theory graphs efficiently, different layouts and highlighting settings will be developed.
